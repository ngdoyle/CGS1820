  <tr>
    <td > 
      <p>In Module 5 you'll learn to use the CSS box model to control the spacing between elements and to display
	  borders and backgrounds. This is important when it comes to displaying a page that is readable and pleasant 
	  to look at. Take your time and go through Chapter 5 to learn some of the interesting features you can use 
	  on your pages such as rounded corners, shadows, and background gradients. </p>
	  <p>Of course, you should continue thinking about the website you will submit at the end of the semester for 
	  your Final Project. After you go through
		this chapter, you can begin thinking about the layout of the pages you are planning for your site. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to  Chapter 5 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Format the Town Hall home page</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercises 5-1 and 5-2 from the end of Chapter 5 (pp. 46-48 in the Lab Manual). 
		 Go through all the Steps (1-17 for Exercise 5-1 and all 
		 of 5-2). Save this home page  with the filename <strong>index.html</strong> and save your updated 
		 stylesheet with the filename <strong>main.css</strong>. </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and upload the files you 
			need for this new home page to display correctly. Be sure to
			place all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.) in their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Even though the URL should be the same as the one you sent for Module 4, you need to re-create 
			the URL and put it in the Mod 4 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. This is the only way I will know that your work 
			has been completed. </li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must</span> test your URL in a browser. Repeat the process of 
			debugging and testing your URL until it works. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, 
			no matter how wonderful your work is, you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. 
				That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	   <p>Refer to Chapter 5 in the textbook to complete this assignment. Remember, for 
     	the Halloween website, you may have to figure out what code to use to make your 
     	page(s) look like the sample given without specific instructions. The 
     	instructions are detailed enough for you to know what needs to be done, but 
     	you still need to use your best judgement for some of the tasks. 
	  Refer to the chapter as needed.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read p. 49 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the specifications from p. 49 of the Lab 
        		Manual, format the Halloween home page. Yours should look like the one 
        		shown on p. 49. It may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> the 
        		same since different browsers render text with some slight differences, 
        		but it should be very close! </li>
       	   <li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
		   <li>Save your stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">main.css</span>.</li>
        	<li>Now create and test the URL to this updated <strong>index.html</strong> page. 
        	Be sure your URL takes you to the page you want your instructor to see!
			<span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
				<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections 
				of this class have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. 
				After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use 
				the solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. 
				If you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into deeper trouble as the semester 
				progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time so it is imperative 
				that your older files are done correctly. After you fix your files (if needed), use the 
				correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>
