    <td> 
      <p>You've already worked with images but in this Module you'll learn more advanced techniques to use
	  when you add images to web pages. You'll learn about the 3 types of images used with websites
	  (<strong>.jpg</strong>, <strong>.gif</strong>, and <strong>.png</strong>) and
	  how to use CSS to align and float images. You will also learn about a few new HTML5 elements that allow you to treat 
	  an image as a figure. And you'll learn to use an image map and to make an image into a link. You'll also learn about 
	  image rollovers and thumbnails.<p>
	  <p>The end of the semester is almost upon us so this is a good time to organize the images you plan to use on your
	  final project. Remember: if you take images from anywhere on the Internet, you must be careful 
	  not to use someone else's work without permission or, if appropriate, giving the original owner credit. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to Chapter 9 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Use an image on the speaker's page and create a rollover</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercise 9-1 from the end of Chapter 9 (p. 89 in the Lab Manual). Go through Steps 
         	1-4. You will be updating the speaker's page so be sure to upload it to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder 
			and check the link from your <strong>index.html</strong> page.</li>
		<li>Complete Exercise Short 9-1 from p. 92 in the Lab Manual. You will make an image rollover for 
			the <strong>c09x_sampson.html</strong> page. You will also need to use the <strong>c09x_rollovers.css</strong> 
			page. Be sure you can see the rollover when you go to this page and 
			save all these pages in their correct folders.</li> 
			<li><span class="strg">Remember to test (and re-test) every link in all the pages before 
			you consider this assignment complete!</span></li>
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and 
        		upload the files you need for these pages to display correctly. 
        		Be sure to place all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.) in 
        		their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Create the URL and put it in the Mod 9 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. 
			Create a separate link to the rollover page since it is not part of the Town Hall website. 
			If there is no way to enter two URLs in the Drop Box, put this URL in the Comment section, as
			plain text.</li>
        	<li>Test your URL in a browser. Continue testing your
        		URL until you are sure it takes the user to the page you want the instructor to see. 
				<span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>Refer to Chapter 9 in the textbook as needed to complete this assignment. As always, for 
     	the Halloween website, you may have to figure out what code to use to make your 
     	page(s) look like the sample given without specific instructions.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read pp. 90-91 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.</li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder using all the correct subfolders. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the instructions from the Lab 
        		Manual, create the new stylesheet, <span class="strg">product.css</span>, and the 
				<span class="strg">cat.html</span> page, following specifications 1-11 in the Lab Manual
				and using the necessary images. </li>
			<li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">cat.html</span>. Be sure to upload this file to
				the correct folder.</li>
		   <li>Save your new stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">product.css</span>. 
		   Be sure to upload this file and all necessary images to the correct folders.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to your <strong>index.html</strong> page. Your instructor should be able
			to navigate to your new pages from this home page. Be sure your URL takes 
			you to the page you want your instructor to see and that the link to your product page
			works! <span class="strg">If you do not send 
			a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
				find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections 
				of this class have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. 
				After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use 
				the solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. 
				 After you fix your files (if needed), use the 
				correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>      </ul>
