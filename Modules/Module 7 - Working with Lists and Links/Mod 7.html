    <td > 
      <p>Nowadays people expect information to be organized and delivered in a clear, efficient manner. Using bulleted and
	  numbered lists is a good way to to do this. There are three main types of lists that can easily be coded with HTML:
	  <strong>unordered lists</strong> (i.e., bulleted lists), <strong>ordered lists</strong> (i.e., numbered lists using numbers or alphabetic characters), and 
	  <strong>description lists</strong> (a bit more about this below). You can combine these types to create nested lists as well. 
	   A description list is a little different from ordered and unordered lists. It contains three elements:
	  <ul><li>The &lt;dl&gt;&lt;/dl&gt; element creates the description list.</li>
	  <li>The &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt; element is used for the term to be defined.</li>
	  <li>The &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; element is used for the definition of the term.</li></ul></p>
	  <p>In Chapter 7 you'll learn how to write the HTML to create all of these lists as well as how to format lists in almost any style you choose. </p>
	  <p>You have been working with links throughout the semester. The Town Hall site links to other pages on the site. The Halloween site has
	  links in the navigation area. In this chapter you will learn to add formatting to your links (like specifying the colors you want to use
	  when a user hovers over a link or visits a link and more). You'll also learn how to use a link to open a new browser window or tab, 
	  how to link to a media file, how to create placeholders, and how to create email, phone, and Skype links. You will also learn to add 
	  formatting or change the way your navigation menu works. <p>
	  <p>After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you
	  	can begin to think about where you might include lists in your final
	  	project. You should also think about how you might want to format various links throughout your final project, whether
		you want a vertical or a horizontal navigation menu, if you want to include a multi-tier navigation menu, and so on. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to Chapter 7 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Enhance the Town Hall home page</h3>
	  <p> You will use a 2-tier menu, a link to a video, and new formatting
	  for the list. You will also add the same navigation menu to the speaker's page.</p>
         <li>Complete Exercises 7-1 and 7-2 from the end of Chapter 7 
         	(pp. 66-68 in the Lab Manual). Go through all the Steps 
         	(1-20 for Exercise 7-1 and 1-4 for 7-2). </li>
         	<li>Save the home page with the filename <strong>index.html</strong>. Save 
         	your updated stylesheet with the filename <strong>main.css</strong>. 
         	Save the speaker page (Exercise 7-2) with the filename <strong>sampson.html</strong>.
         	Be sure to save all these pages in their correct folders.</li> 
			<li><span class="strg">Be sure to test (and re-test) every link in both pages before you 
			consider this assignment complete!</span></li>
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and 
        		upload the files you need for these pages to display correctly. 
        		Be sure to place all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.) in 
        		their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Even though the URL should be the same as the one you sent me for 
        		previous modules, you need to re-create the URL and put it in the 
				Mod 7 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. This is the only way I will know that your work has been completed. </li>
        	<li>Remember to test your URL in a browser. Continue testing your
        		URL until you are sure it takes the user to the page you want the instructor to see. 
				<span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>Refer to  Chapter 7 in the textbook to complete this assignment. Remember, for 
     	the Halloween website, you may have to figure out what code to use to make your 
     	page(s) look like the sample given without specific instructions. Refer to the chapter as needed.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read p. 69 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the specifications from p. 69 of the Lab 
        		Manual, format the Halloween home page. Yours should look like the one 
        		shown on p. 69. It may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> the 
        		same, but it should be very close! </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Extra part:</span> Under the paragraph that ends with the text <strong>"...No questions asked!"</strong> add
			the following line with an email link to your own email. If you don't want to use your own email, you
			can make up any fake email. Include: <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="strg">Email me with any questions or comments.</span>
				[<strong>Email me</strong> should be the link to an email.]<br>
				When the user clicks on <strong>Email me</strong>, an email should be started that is populated 
				with the following data:<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To: you@whatever.com<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CC: yourInstructorFirstName.LastName@sfcollege.edu<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: The Halloween Store<br></strong></li>
       	   <li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
		   <li>Save your stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">main.css</span>.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to this updated <strong>index.html</strong> page. </li>
        	<li>Now create and test the URL to this updated index.html page. Be sure your URL takes 
			you to the page you want your instructor to see! <span class="strg">If you do not send a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
				find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections 
				of this class have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. 
				After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use 
				the solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. 
				If you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into deeper trouble as the semester 
				progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time so it is imperative 
				that your older files are done correctly. After you fix your files (if needed), use the 
				correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>
