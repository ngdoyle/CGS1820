      <p>You're out shopping for a Halloween costume but the first store you go to doesn't have what you want. Do you run home to search for 
	  Halloween costume stores on the laptop you left on your desk? Of course not. You use your smartphone. You're eating dinner in a 
	  restaurant and plan to hear a speaker from the San Joaquin Valley Town Hall but you forgot what time the speaker is scheduled 
	  for. You need to know if you'll be late if you order a dessert right now. Is that a problem? Of course not; 
	  you can pull up the website on your phone. Nowadays we expect that virtually any website 
	  we need to see can be accessed from our phones or tablets. It is, therefore, <span class="emph">essential</span> that any
	  website you create be visible on a screen that may be huge or tiny. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the technique used to create 
	  websites that adapt to any screen size. And that's what you'll learn to do in this Module. </p>
	  <p>You'll learn how to use a fluid layout to allow the width of the page and its main elements to increase and decrease, depending
		on the size of the screen. You will learn to use scalable images, media queries, how to set the viewport, and to use a jQuery plugin
		called SlikNav to convert a navigation menu to a menu that can be used on small devices. All this will ensure that your 
		website won't look like a disaster when it is viewed on a tiny screen, a tablet, or a large monitor. <p>
	  <p>After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you might want to apply responsive design to the pages
	  you have been working on for your final project. Adjusting font sizes from pixels to ems, adding media queries, and so on at this 
	  point will make your life much easier at the end when preparing your final project for viewing by the whole class.</p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to Chapter 8 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Convert the Town Hall home page to use a responsive design</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercise 8-1 from the end of Chapter 8 (pp. 76-78 in the Lab Manual). Go through all the Steps (1-31). 
         	Save the home page with the filename <strong>index.html</strong>. Save 
         	your updated stylesheet with the filename <strong>main.css</strong>. 
         	Be sure to save all these pages in their correct folders.</li> 
			<li><span class="strg">Be sure to test (and re-test) every link in both pages before you consider 
			this assignment complete!</span></li>
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and 
        		upload the files you need for these pages to display correctly. 
        		Be sure to place all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.) in 
        		their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Create the URL and put it in the Mod 8 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. This is the only way I will know that your work has been completed. </li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must</span> test your URL in a browser. Continue testing your
        		URL until you are sure it takes the user to the page you want the instructor to see. 
				<span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
       <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	   <p>Refer to  Chapter 8 in the textbook to complete this assignment. Remember, for 
     	the Halloween website, you may have to figure out what code to use to make your 
     	page(s) look like the sample given without specific instructions. Refer to the chapter as needed.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read pp. 79-82 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the specifications from the Lab 
        		Manual, format the Halloween home page using a fluid layout. When you are done, yours should look like the  
        		images shown on pp. 80, 81, and 82. If you choose, you may delete the email link you 
				added in the previous module so your page can match more closely with the one in the Lab Manual. 
				It may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> the 
        		same since different browsers render text with some slight differences, 
        		but it should be very close! </li>
			<li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
		   <li>Save your new stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">main_rwd.css</span>. Be sure to upload this file to the
				correct folder.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to this updated <strong>index.html</strong> page. Be sure your URL takes 
			you to the page you want your instructor to see! Check your responsive design by 
			making the browser window smaller and larger. <span class="strg">If you do not send a working URL, 
			no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
				find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections 
				of this class have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. 
				After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use 
				the solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. 
				If you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into deeper trouble as the semester 
				progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time so it is imperative 
				that your older files are done correctly. After you fix your files (if needed), use the 
				correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>
