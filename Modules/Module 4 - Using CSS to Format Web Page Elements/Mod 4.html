  <tr>
    <td > 
      <p>In Module 4 you'll begin making your pages look stylish... with styles. Chapter 4 is about 
	  how web pages use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to alter the presentation of various items. There's so much 
	  to learn about CSS that it spans 3 chapters in the text. This week we will focus on the material in
	  Chapter 4. You'll learn to apply different styles to various HTML elements and also how to change the styles 
	  within elements using element types, ids, classes, selectors, and more. </p>
	  <p>Of course, you should continue thinking about the website you will submit at the end of the semester for 
	  your Final Project. After you go through
		this chapter, you can begin thinking about a color scheme for your site. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to  Chapter 4 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Format the Town Hall home page</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercise 4-1 from the end of Chapter 4 (pp. 38-40 in the Lab Manual). Go through all the 
		 Steps (1-18). Save this home page  with 
		 the filename <strong>index.html</strong>. </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla and inside the <strong>townhall</strong> folder, upload the files you need for this 
			new home page to display correctly. Be sure to
			place all necessary files in their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Even though the URL should be the same as the one you sent for Module 3, you need to re-create 
			the URL and put it in the Mod 4 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. This is the only way I will know that your work 
			has been completed. </li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must (yes, must!)</span> test your URL in a browser. Enter it into the 
        		address bar of a browser and make sure you see the page you created. If you don't see your page or
        		if you get a File Not Found message, go back and double-check the URL. Check to make sure that
        		you didn't misspell anything, that you didn't put in any spaces, that you didn't use uppercase
        		letters when you needed lowercase, and so on. Repeat the process of creating and testing your
        		URL until it works. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter 
				how wonderful your work is, you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit the assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. 
				That's all you need to submit for this part.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>Refer to Chapter 4 in the textbook to complete this assignment. Remember, for the Halloween website, you 
	  may have to figure out what code to use to make your page(s) look like the sample given without 
	  specific instructions. The instructions are detailed enough for you to know what needs to be done, 
	  but you still need to use your best judgement for some of the tasks. Refer to the chapter as needed.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read p. 41-42 in the Lab Manual and find the files you need.</li> 
        	<li>Using the image shown and the specifications from pp. 41-42 of the Lab Manual, format the 
			Halloween home page. Yours should look like the one shown on p. 41. It may not be 
			<span class="emph">exactly</span> the same since different browsers 
			render text with some slight differences, but it should be very close! </li>
       	   <li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
		   <li>Save your stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">main.css</span>.</li>
		   <li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to upload the work for this module inside your <strong>halloween</strong> folder. </li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to this updated <strong>index.html</strong> page. </li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must (yes, must!)</span> test your URL in a browser. Repeat the process of 
			creating and testing your
        		URL until it works. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful 
				your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections of this class 
			have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. After you receive a 
			grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use the solution files to fix 
			your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. Your grade on this assignment will 
			not change (sorry...) but if you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into deeper trouble 
			as the semester progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time so it is 
			<span class="strg">imperative</span> that your older files are done correctly. After you fix your 
			files (if needed), use the correct files to begin working on the next Module.
