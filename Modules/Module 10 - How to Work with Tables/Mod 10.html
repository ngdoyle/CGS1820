      <p>While most of the time we format our pages using CSS for layout, there are times you may want or 
	  need to add a table to your web pages. Tables aren't just used to display, for example, a table of data.
	  By making the cells invisible it is possible to use tables to line up content in ways that may be 
	  difficult to do with CSS. And many web site "wizards" (like WordPress) are built around concepts 
	  used in tables so understanding how they work can be very helpful if you work for a company 
	  that expects you to work on one of those sites. While there are many components associated with 
	  tables (rows, columns header cells, data cells, table header, table footer, and table body), 
	  it is most important to understand how to format a table so your
	  content displays as you want it to be seen. <p>
	  <p>By now your final project should be well on its way to completion. Take this time to make some adjustments. 
	  Maybe you will want to use some of the things you learn in this module or the previous one to make your website more 
	  interesting and professional. Think about a good place to use a table in your project. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to Chapter 10 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Add a table to the luncheons page of the Town Hall site</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercise 10-1 from the end of Chapter 10 (pp. 96-97 in the Lab Manual). Go through Steps 
         	1-11. You will be updating the Luncheons page so be sure to upload it to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder 
			and check the link from your <strong>index.html</strong> page. Be sure to treat the table as a figure, 
			provide for accessibility, and see if you can replace some of your class selectors with pseudo-class
			selectors. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Remember to test (and re-test) every link in all the pages before you 
			consider this assignment complete!</span></li>
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and 
        		upload the files you need for these pages to display correctly. 
        		Be sure to place all necessary files in their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Put the URL to the Town Hall home page into the 
				Mod 10 Town Hall Lab Drop Box.</li>
			<li>Test your URL in a browser. Continue testing until you are sure it takes the user to the page 
			you want the instructor to see and that you can navigate from the home page to the Luncheons page. 
				<span class="strg">If your instructor cannot find your new work, you will get no credit for it.</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. 
				That's all you need to submit.</li>      
		</ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>Refer to Chapter 10 in the textbook to complete this assignment as needed. </p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read pp. 98-99 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder using all the correct subfolders. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the instructions from the Lab 
        		Manual, create the new product list and the pages that go with each product, including the 
				<span class="strg">cat.html</span> page from a previous Module. Note that, for each product page you
				can name the file as you choose. Be sure to also create the new stylesheet, 
				<span class="strg">summary.css</span>, following the specifications in the Lab Manual. 
				As always, your page may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> the 
        		same as the image shown but it should be very close. </li>
			<li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span> and upload it to
				the correct folder.</li>
		   <li>Be sure to upload your new stylesheet and your product pages to the correct folders along 
				with any necessary images.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to the home page <span class="strg">index.html</span>. Your instructor
should be able to navigate from there to your new pages. </li>
			<li>For this assignment, you will have many new links. <span class="strg">Check and double-check 
			each link</span> before you submit the assignment for a grade. Be sure your URL takes 
			you to the Halloween site home page and that all the links that should work actually
			do work! <span class="strg">If your site links don't work you cannot get credit for all
that you may have done.</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
				find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
      </ul>
	  <h3> And that's all! You have learned soooo much!</h3>
	  <p>Hopefully, you have been working on your Final Project throughout the semester. But now you can
focus on using all the skills from the semester to create a truly stunning project. There's a lot more to
learn about web authoring but you have the basics now. I hope, when you look at your Final Project, you
will be pleasantly surprised and proud of your accomplishment.</p>
