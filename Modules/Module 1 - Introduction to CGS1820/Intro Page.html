    <td > 
      <p>In Module 1 we will review the course syllabus and policies. We will become familiar with several systems 
      	that will be used in this course: Canvas, the textbook, several browsers, and a text editor. </p>
      <p>The book that is required for this class is <strong><em> Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 </em></strong>(3rd edition) by 
	  Boehm and Ruvalcaba. 
      	From now on we will simply refer to the textbook as the <strong>text</strong>.</p>
      	<p>In this course you will work on files that you download to your own computer and you will create your own 
		files from scratch. You will submit your work either by uploading files directly to our LMS (Canvas) 
		or by posting them on our server and creating a link to those files which you will enter in a Drop Box here 
		in Canvas. You will create your work in a text editor which
      		you need to download onto your own computer. Already, you can see that it may be confusing. I'll do my best to clarify each
      		item. In fact, this first week will mainly consist of you becoming familiar with these various programs and how you use 
      		each of them. Let's take them one at a time.</p>
      <h4>Canvas </h4>
      <p>Canvas is the Learning Management System (LMS) used by Santa Fe College for students to communicate online 
	  with instructors and other
      	students. It has many (many!) different features and each instructor uses it differently. In my class you will 
		use the following:</p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Use the <span class="strg">email</span> feature (the <span class="strg">Inbox</span>) to communicate with me 
			about course-related issues. Do <strong>not</strong> send me emails through my sfcollege.edu account. 
			I only answer course-related 
      			questions through Canvas email. </li>
      		<li>Use the <span class="strg">Assignment</span> feature to submit your homework. You will either upload 
			files or enter a URL 
      			(specified in each assignment) in each Assignment Drop Box. There is a place in each Drop Box for you to 
				enter a 
      			<span class="strg">comment</span>.
      				Do <strong>not</strong> use this space to ask questions about your homework unless you do not need 
					the answer until <span class="ital">after</span> the grade is
      				posted. <strong>Note:</strong> I don't read these comments until after the due date for that assignment. 
					If you have questions that need
      				my attention before you submit your homework, send those through the Inbox. After I grade an assignment, 
					you will receive a comment 
      				from me explaining why you lost points (if you lost any) or anything else I want to tell you about that assignment.</li>
      		<li>Use the <span class="strg">Grades</span> tab to check your grades.</li>
      		<li>Check the <span class="strg">Announcements</span> at least twice a week. This is where I will post 
			extra explanations, if needed,
      			explain an extended due date if something unforseen has come up, identify an error or typo if one is
				found, etc.</li>
      		<li>The <span class="strg">Calendar</span> is where you will find due dates for assignments and exams. 
			I may, if a situation warrants
      			it, extend a due date. I will never make a due date earlier than the original.</li>
      		<li>The <span class="strg">Modules</span> area is the <strong>most important</strong> place for you! 
			This is where I post a document (like
      			this one but probably a lot shorter after this week) that will explain exactly what the topic is for 
				that Module and exactly
      			what you need to do for a grade. Please read the entire document each week -- don't just skip to the 
				end where it lists
      			what to turn in. Often you will find extra information or clues about how to complete the homework 
				in the document.</li>
      		<li>There is also a <span class="strg">Discussion Board</span> feature. I have no requirement
      			for students to post to a Discussion Board until we get to the Final Project. 
				However, this is a great resource for you so you should use it! Here, you
      			can ask for help and get it from all the other students in the class. 
				<strong>Note:</strong> I do not get any notification that a
      			message has been posted on a Discussion Board so, if you want me to see anything you post to a 
				Discussion Board, please send me an email (via the
      			Inbox) and ask me to look at your posting. I try to remember to check the Discussions but I 
				could forget... Another 
      			<strong>good reason to use Discussions</strong> is that this is how developers in the "real world" work -- they ask and answer
      			questions through forums and online Discussions. So you will be practicing a skill you will need on the job.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>Take some time this week to become familiar with how this course works. Take a look at the Calendar. It may not 
		be complete
      	the first week but all the due dates will be filled in soon. Send me a test message through the Inbox, if you have never
      	used it, just to get familiar with it. Click around. Then get started on the work for this week. </p>
      	
      <h4>The ITE Server </h4>
      <p>This course will teach you how to create relatively simple web pages and turn them into a professional-looking
	  website. Equally important, though, 
	  is learning how to post those
      	pages live on the Internet. The ITE Area gives you a way to do that. ITE manages our own server and each student gets 
      	space on that server. This is where you upload the pages you create to see them live. You'll learn how to do 
		that in the next
      	Module. You will be given an ITE account and will learn how to use it by uploading files through a <span class="strg">
      		File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client</span>. We will use a free FTP program called <span class="strg">Filezilla</span> and
      		instructions will be provided for you.
      		
      <h4>The Text Editor </h4>
      <p>You don't need any fancy software to make web pages. In fact, in this course, if you do use a software program like
      	Dreamweaver or the HTML editor in Word, you will not get any credit for your work. These programs do the 
		coding for you. This 
      	course teaches you to do the coding yourself. If you don't learn how to code, you cannot be a developer 
		because a developer 
      	not only writes his/her own code, but must edit the code written by others. </p>
      	<p>Therefore, you need a <span class="strg">text editor</span> to do the work in this class. There are several excellent
      		 free ones and you can select from those. 
      		 <ul>
      		 	<li><strong>Notepad</strong> or <strong>Text Wrangler</strong> come pre-loaded on Windows or Macs. 
				However, while 
      		 		these are fine text editors,
      		 		they do not provide the extra features which are very helpful and are available with other free text editors.</li>
      		 	<li><strong>Notepad++</strong> is an excellent choice. This is the one we recommend and is also the 
				one your instructor will support. There will be further instructions on how to install and use
				Notepad++ but you can simply type <span class="strg">Notepad++</span> into Google to find a free download.</li>
      		 	<li>The textbook uses <strong>Aptana</strong> and has instructions about how to get it, install it, and, 
				for the content of the course, use it. However, while Aptana has wonderful features for an advanced
				developer, it may be too complicated for beginners who don't need most of its features. So, if you 
				are feeling adventurous, you can download and use Aptana, following the instructions in the textbook. For 
				the purposes of this course, it is a fine editor but Notepad++ works better (we think) for what you 
				need in this course and the rest of the Web Authoring sequence. If you try to use Aptana, though, 
				be aware that your instructor cannot help you with it. The "official" editor for CGS1820 is 
				Notepad++.</li>
      		 </ul>
      <h3> Homework: Getting Started </h3>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read the <span class="strg">Syllabus</span>. Be sure you understand everything in the Syllabus. If any part 
			is not clear, send
         		me an email through the Inbox and ask. </li>
        <li>Read Chapter 1 in the <strong>text</strong>. 
        <li>Read the information on how to get <strong>Notepad++</strong> or, if you prefer,
		go to <span class="strg">Appendix A</span> and get <strong>Aptana</strong>:
        	<ol>
        		<li>Be sure you have installed both <strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>Firefox</strong> on the computer you 
        			will use to create and test your work.</li>
        		<li>Download the <strong>source code</strong> for the textbook examples and exercises (instructions in Appendix A).</li>
        	</ol> 
        <li>Complete as a lab, on your own: Exercises 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 from the end of Chapter 1 in the text (pp. 10-13 in Lab Manual).</li>   
      </ul>
