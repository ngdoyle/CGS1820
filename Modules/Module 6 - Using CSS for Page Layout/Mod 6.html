      <p>Most web pages today are broken up into various sections. Often the 
      	navigation is on the left, the main information is in the center, and 
      	there may be a sidebar on the right. To achieve this in a web page we use
      	columns. Chapter 6 will show you how to use CSS to format pages with
      	2 or 3 columns. You'll learn how to use fixed-width column layouts and
      	fluid layouts and, most important, how to ensure that elements appear
      	correctly, regardless of the user's screen size or resolution. </p>
	  <p>After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you
	  	can begin to think about the type of layout you want for your final
	  	project. </p>
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Refer to  Chapter 6 in the textbook to complete this assignment. </p>
      <h3> Lab Work: Enhance the Town Hall home page and add two Speaker pages</h3>
         <li>Complete Exercises 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 from the end of Chapter 6 
         	(pp. 54-58 in the Lab Manual). Go through all the Steps 
         	(1-10 for Exercise 6-1, 1-10 for 6-2, and 1-11 for 6-3). 
         	Save the home page with the filename <strong>index.html</strong>. Save 
         	your updated stylesheet with the filename <strong>main.css</strong>. 
         	Save the Speaker page (Exercise 6-3) with the filename <strong>sampson.html</strong>.
         	Be sure to save all these pages in their correct folders.</li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Navigate to your <strong>townhall</strong> folder and 
        		upload the files you need for these pages to display correctly. 
        		Be sure to place all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.) in 
        		their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Even though the URL should be the same as the one you sent me for 
        		previous modules, you need to re-create the URL and put it in the 
				Mod 6 Town Hall Lab Drop Box. This is the only way I will know that your work has been completed. </li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must</span> test your URL in a browser. Continue testing your
        		URL until you are sure it takes the user to the page you want the instructor to see. 
				<span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>Refer to  Chapter 6 in the textbook to complete this assignment. Remember, for 
     	the Halloween website, you may have to figure out what code to use to make your 
     	page(s) look like the sample given without specific instructions. The 
     	instructions are detailed enough for you to know what needs to be done, but 
     	you still need to use your best judgement for some of the tasks. 
	  Refer to the chapter as needed.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read p. 59 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Be sure to save the work for this module inside 
        		your <strong>halloween</strong> folder. </li>
        	<li>Using the image shown and the specifications from p. 59 of the Lab 
        		Manual, format the Halloween home page. Yours should look like the one 
        		shown on p. 59. It may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> the 
        		same since different browsers render text with some slight differences, 
        		but it should be very close! </li>
       	   <li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
		   <li>Save your stylesheet with the filename <span class="strg">main.css</span>.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to this updated <strong>index.html</strong> page. </li>
        	<li>Now create and test the URL to this updated index.html page. Be sure your URL takes 
			you to the page you want your instructor to see! <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
				find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections 
				of this class have passed, your instructor will release the solution files for this assignment. 
				After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, you should use 
				the solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. 
				If you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into deeper trouble as the semester 
				progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time so it is imperative 
				that your older files are done correctly. After you fix your files (if needed), use the 
				correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>
