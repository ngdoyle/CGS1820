    <td > 
      <p>In Module 2 you will code simple web pages, test them in various browsers, and use the Validator through W3Schools to make sure
      	your code is correct. You will also upload files to the ITE server and submit a URL that will link to your page. </p>
      	
      <h4>Install Filezilla</h4>
      <p><span class = "strg">Filezilla</span> is simply a program that allows you to transfer files from your own computer
      	to a server or download files from your account on a server back to your computer. It is called an FTP client
      	because it uses a <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong> and makes transferring files both fast and efficient.
      	<span class="strg">Please note:</span> You can't view the contents of your files with Filezilla. You can't edit files from inside
      	Filezilla. All you do is upload and download files. Filezilla has some advanced features but, for this course, please
      	simply use it as a method to transfer files. Do <strong>not</strong>, by the way, use Filezilla to help you create a URL;
      	it won't work. Follow the instructions I will provide.</p>
      <p>You can get Filezilla by simply Googling it. However, the textbook will walk you through this process. Go to Chapter 19
      	in the book, pp. 642-647, and follow the instructions. Further instructions about your hostname, username, and password
      	are given in the link (shown below)</p>
     
      <h4>Get your ITE server account</h4>	
      	<p>Now you need to get to your account on the ITE server. Our IT administrator creates these accounts every semester. If, after
      	following the <a href = "http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~elizabeth.drake/ite_serv_instr.htm">instructions here</a>, you cannot find your account, you should contact me by Canvas email and I will help you find
      	your account or ensure that one is created.</p>
      	
      	
      		
      <h4>Important Notes </h4>
      <p>Once you have installed Filezilla, entered the correct hostname, username, and password, you should see your account
      	on the right side of the Filezilla screen and your computer's files on the left side.</p>
      	<ul><li><span class = "strg">Never (never!)</span> delete the <span class="strg">public_html</span> folder! You must be 
      		<strong>inside</strong> this folder to upload files you want to submit for grading. Any files uploaded outside
      		this folder can only be seen by you; they are not live on the Internet.</li>
      		<li>You will see a file called <span class="strg">index.html</span> in your public_html folder. It is simply a default
   			test page. You can leave it there, overwrite it with your own content or delete it.</li>
      		</ul>
      		
      		
      <h3> Homework: Coding, Testing, Uploading, Creating a URL </h3>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read Chapter 2 in the <strong>text</strong>.</li> 
        	<li>Complete, on your own and not for a grade: Exercises 2-1 and 2-2 from the end of Chapter 2 (pp. 18-20 in the Lab Manual).</li>
        	<li>Complete Exercise 2-3 from the end of Chapter 2 (p. 21 in the Lab Manual). You will create two pages on your own computer:
        		<strong>testpage.html</strong> and <strong>testpage.css</strong>. You will now upload both of these to your
        		account on the ITE server and send me the URL so I can view and grade them. </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla and, using the <a href ="http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~elizabeth.drake/ite_serv_instr.htm" >
        		instructions here</a>, enter the hostname, your username, and your password. You should see your account
        		on the right-hand side of the screen. <br>
        		<span class="strg">*** Important Note! ***</span> Do not delete or rename the <strong>public_html</strong> folder! This 
        		was created when your account was created. In order for your files to be seen on the Internet (and by your teacher
        		for grading), they must be <span class="ital">inside</span> this folder. You can, if you wish, store files outside this folder but that is
        		only your personal storage space and no one but you can view anything outside the public_html folder.
<ul>
  <li>Double-click to get inside the public_html folder. You will see a page named <strong>index.html</strong>.
        			This is a default page that was created when your site was made. You can leave it there, delete it, write over
        			it, as you wish.  </li>
        			<li>Create a new folder inside public_html. Name this folder <span class="strg">cgs1820</span>. Now
        				create a folder inside this new folder named <span class="strg">ch02</span>.</li>
        			<li>On the left side of the Filezilla screen you should see the files and folders from your
        					own computer. Navigate to wherever you saved the two files you created for Exercise 2-3:
        					<strong>testpage.html</strong> and <strong>testpage.css</strong>.</li>
        			<li>Upload these two files into the <span class="strg">ch02 folder on the remote side</span>. </li></ul></li>
        	<li>Now create a URL to your <strong>testpage.html</strong>. In the beginning, you may want to write it on a piece of paper and then 
        		type it into a browser or you can open up a new tab or window in a browser and type it in directly. The URL
        		consists of the following parts:
        		<ul>
        			<li><span class="strg">http://</span> is the protocol.</li>
        			<li><span class="strg">home.ite.sfcollege.edu/</span> is the domain.</li>
        			<li><span class="strg">~your_username/cgs1820/ch02/</span> is the path. (Note that the 
        				<span class="strg">tilde (~)</span> symbol is an important part of the URL.)</li>
        			<li><span class="strg">testpage.html</span> is the filename.</li>
        			</ul>
        			For example, if my username is dotty.q.throckmeyer, my URL would be:<br>
        			<strong>http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~dotty.q.throckmeyer/cgs1820/02/testpage.html</strong></li>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must (yes, must!)</span> test your URL in a browser. Enter it into the 
        		address bar of a browser and make sure you see the page you created. If you don't see your page or
        		if you get a File Not Found message, go back and double-check the URL. Check to make sure that
        		you didn't misspell anything, that you didn't put in any spaces, that you didn't use uppercase
        		letters when you needed lowercase, and so on. Repeat the process of creating and testing your
        		URL until it works. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your work is, 
        		your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. That's all you need to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> A Little Extra Stuff </h3>
      <li>While there is no requirement in this course for posting on a Discussion Board, you'll get brownie points (whatever
      	they are) for contributing to discussions on the Discussion Board about the following:
      	<ul><li>What does the tilde (~) in your URL mean?</li>
      		<li>Your account has a default page named index.html. Why do you think this page was automatically created
      			when your account was created?</li>
      		<li>Try this: remove the filename <strong>testpage.html</strong> from your URL in a browser and see what 
      			happens. Do you get an error? Why or why not?</li>
      		<li>Your URL links to a page named testpage.html. So why did you need to upload the second file, 
      			<strong>testpage.css</strong>, for your work to display properly? </li>
      		<li>What if your teacher wanted to see your code for testpage.css? How could the teacher view it, 
      			given the URL you submitted?</li>
      	</ul></li>
