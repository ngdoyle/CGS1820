    <td > 
      <p>In Module 3 you will start creating some interesting web pages. For most of the modules, you will 
	  have a chance to practice the skills taught in that chapter by adding to a site
	  called Town Hall. Then you will build a website called Halloween. And you'll also begin to 
	  think about a website that you will create from scratch, to be submitted at the end of the semester 
	  for your Final Project.  </p>
	  <p>The solutions to the Town Hall site are provided in your Student Files. However, you should follow the
	  instructions in the Lab Manual and first try to code the site on your own. Then, if you get stuck, refer to
	  the solution files and fix up your pages. Since the website builds on everything you do, you need to have
	  each chapter's site done correctly to complete the work in the next chapter. But this practice will help 
you a great deal when you start doing the graded homework.<p>
	  <p>You will not get a grade for the Town Hall pages. However, you must complete them (the grade is either
	  'done' or 'not done') to earn the 15% of your ungraded homework (lab work) grade. Obviously, because you have
	  the solution files, you should always be able to complete this part perfectly. Your on-campus instructor will explain
	  his/her rules about how lab work must be turned in during class time. Online students should upload these
	  pages to the appropriate Drop Box. 
      	
      <h4>Read and Practice</h4>
      <p>Read Chapter 3 in the textbook. This chapter is full of new things--all the basic elements of a web page. </p>
      <p>Please pay special attention to the folder structure described on p. 26 of the Lab Manual. 
	  In the beginning it may seem silly to use an elaborate folder structure for a simple web page but you are 
	  not just learning to make a simple page. You are learning to become a web developer and, in the
	  &quot;real world&quot; where web sites consist of many (even hundreds) of pages, a folder structure 
	  like the one shown in the text is essential. </p>
     
      
      <h3> Lab Work: The Town Hall Web Site</h3>
         <ul>
         	<li>Complete Exercise 3-1 from the end of Chapter 3 (pp. 26-29 in the Lab Manual). Go through all the 
			Steps (1-21). Save this home page  with the filename <strong>index.html</strong>. </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla and, inside your <strong>cgs1820</strong> folder which is inside the 
			<strong>public_html</strong> folder, 
        	  create a new folder named <span class="strg">townhall</span>. 
			  Be sure <span class="ital">not </span>to put a space between the words 'town' and 'hall'.</li>
       	   <li>Inside the <strong>townhall</strong> folder, create the folder structure as shown in the text 
		   (or p. 26 in the Lab Manual) and upload all files that go with the Town Hall 
		   project into their correct folders. </li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to your <strong>index.html</strong> page. You may want to write it on a piece of 
			paper and then type it into a browser or you can open up a new tab or window in a browser and 
			type it in directly. Remember: The URL consists of the following parts:	</li>
        	<ul>
        	<li><span class="strg">http://</span> is the protocol</li>
        	<li><span class="strg">home.ite.sfcollege.edu/</span> is the domain</li>
        	<li><span class="strg">~your_username/cgs1820/townhall/</span> is the path. </li>
   			  <li><span class="strg">index.html</span> is the filename. </li>
   			  <li>Remember:  the <span class="strg">tilde (~)</span> symbol is an important part of the URL.</li>
   			  </ul>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must (yes, must!)</span> test your URL in a browser. Enter it into the 
        		address bar of a browser and make sure you see the page you created. If you don't see your page or
        		if you get a File Not Found message, go back and double-check the URL. Check to make sure that
        		you didn't misspell anything, that you didn't put in any spaces, that you didn't use uppercase
        		letters when you needed lowercase, and so on. Repeat the process of creating and testing your
        		URL until it works. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter 
				how wonderful your work is, you will get no credit for it because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit the assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. 
				That's all you need to submit for this part.</li>
      </ul>
	  
      <h3> Homework: The Halloween Case Study</h3>
	  <p>This assignment will be graded. Refer to Chapter 3 in the textbook to complete this assignment. 
	  For the Halloween homework assignments
	  you get instructions about what to do but they are, as the Lab Manual says, &quot;detailed enough for you 
	  to know what needs to be done, but you'll need to use your best judgement on how to code many of the details.&quot; 
	  No one expects you to remember everything you learn in a chapter after one week. So refer to the chapter 
	  as needed as you create this assignment.</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Read p. 30 in  the Lab Manual and find the files you need.  </li> 
        	<li>Open Filezilla. Inside your <strong>cgs1820</strong> folder which is inside the <strong>public_html</strong> 
			folder, create a new folder named <span class="strg">halloween</span>. This is where you will save all 
			the files you create for the Halloween Case Study throughout the semester. </li>
        	<li>Inside the <strong>halloween</strong> folder, create the folder structure as shown in the text 
			(or p. 26 in the Lab Manual) and upload all files that go with this Halloween 
		   project into their correct folders. </li>
       	   <li>Using the image shown and the Specifications from p. 31 of the Lab Manual, create the Halloween 
		   home page. Yours should look like the one shown on p. 31. It may not be <span class="emph">exactly</span> 
		   the same since different browsers render text with some slight differences, but it should be very close! </li>
       	   <li>Save your page with the filename <span class="strg">index.html</span>.</li>
        	<li>Now create the URL to this <strong>index.html</strong> page. You may want to write it on a 
			piece of paper and then 
       		type it into a browser or you can open up a new tab or window in a browser and type it in directly. 
			The URL consists of the following parts:</li>
        	<ul>
        	<li><span class="strg">http://</span> is the protocol</li>
        	<li><span class="strg">home.ite.sfcollege.edu/</span> is the domain</li>
        	<li><span class="strg">~your_username/cgs1820/halloween/</span> is the path. </li>
   			  <li><span class="strg">index.html</span> is the filename. </li>
   			  <li>Remember:  the <span class="strg">tilde (~)</span> symbol is an important part of the URL.</li>
		   </ul>
        	<li>Next you <span class="strg">must (yes, must!)</span> test your URL in a browser, just as you did for
			the Town Hall site. <span class="strg">If you do not send me a working URL, no matter how wonderful your 
			work is, your grade will be a zero because I won't be able to see it!</span></li>
        	<li>Finally, submit your assignment. Go to the <span class="strg">Assignment </span>tab in Canvas, 
			find the <span class="strg">Drop Box</span> for this assignment, 
        		and <span class="strg">copy the working URL you have created into that Drop Box</span>. </li>
			<li><span class="strg">Very important stuff:</span> Once the due dates for all sections of this class have passed, your instructor will release the
			solution files for this assignment. After you receive a grade, if you had any problems creating this assignment, 
			you should use the
			solution files to fix your pages before going on to the next Halloween assignment. Your grade on this
			assignment will not change (sorry...) but if you don't fix your pages now, you will only get into
			deeper trouble as the semester progresses. The Halloween project builds on what you do each time
			so it is <span class="strg">imperative</span> that your older files are done correctly. After you fix
			your files (if needed), use the correct files to begin working on the next Module.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> A Little Extra Stuff </h3>
      <p>While there is no requirement in this course for posting on a Discussion Board, you'll get brownie points 
	  (whatever they are) for contributing to discussions on the Discussion Board about the following: <br>
      	Why can you use the same filename, index.html, for both the Town Hall website and the 
		Halloween website? What's up with that? Why doesn't one index.html file overwrite the other when you
		upload it to the ITE server? </p>
