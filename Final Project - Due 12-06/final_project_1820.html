      <p>Now it's time to put everything we have learned together and have a lot of fun. You will be 
	  pleasantly surprised when you see what a great website you can now create. </p>
         <p>In this Module you will <span class="strg">create your Final Project.</span> If you have been doing 
		 all the homework all semester, your final project should be almost complete. Your website must 
		 consist of at least three web pages and the specifics are listed below. Have fun! This site must
		be shared with everyone in the class so follow the directions about how to send in your URL carefully. 
		<span class="strg">The Final Project counts for 15% of your grade. </span></p>
		<p>Finally you'll <span class="strg">view everyone's web sites.</span> There will be a 
		<span class="strg">Discussion Board </span> where each member of the class will post the URL to his/her site. 
		This is so that everyone in the class can see all the sites. You'll get lots of great ideas for 
		your next website from looking at what everyone else in the class has done.</p>
         <p>Each item listed below is worth 8 points for a total of 88 points. The other 12 points come 
		 from viewing and commenting on your classmates' work. But if you upload your project late and 
		 your classmates don't have time to view and comment on it, you will not get a passing grade 
		 for this Project. Also, you must comment on your classmates' sites. Even if your Project is 
		 perfect in every way, if you don't enter comments on your classmates' work, the highest grade 
		 you can get is an 88%. Check the due dates for posting your Project and for commenting on 
		 other Projects on the Calendar.</p>

    <td ><p class="strg">Here are the Final Project instructions.</p>
  <p>Design an entire website which must contain the following items but can contain anything else you want to 
  add. The list below is the list of <span class="strg">minimum requirements</span>. </p>

  <ol>
 <li>The site must have <strong>three pages</strong>.  Each page must link to the other two. </li>
  <li> You must use <strong>CSS styles</strong> for presentational aspects of your page.  You should have an external 
  (linked) style sheet for a consistent &quot;look and feel&quot; to the whole site but you can also 
  use any combination of inline and embedded styles to modify specific items. The entire site should 
  have one design theme. The color scheme should be reflected on all the pages unless there is a good
  reason for one page to deviate from the rest. </li>
  <li> The <strong>Page Title</strong> should tell the viewer what your site is about and what aspect of the site each page 
  is about. The Page Titles on all the pages should relate to the subject of your site. </li>
	<li>The <strong>CSS box model</strong> should be used to control the spacing between elements on your pages
	and to display any borders or backgrounds.</li>
    <li>The site must use a <strong>consistent navigation scheme</strong>.</li>
	<li>At least one page should have a <strong>2-column or 3-column layout</strong>.</li>
	<li>Your page should use <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>, as described in Chapter 8. </li>
	<li> Your site should have at least one image with an <strong>image swap, map, and/or rollover</strong>.  
  Be sure to use free images if you get images from the web and give credit where credit is due! 
  The credit should include a link to the site where you found the image as well as the aritist 
  or photographer's name, if available The same, of course, is true for any information you copy
    from another website. </li>
	<li>There must be a minimum of two <strong>lists</strong>: an ordered or unordered list and a description list.</li>
  <li>There must be at least one <strong>table</strong> somewhere in the site.</li>
  <li>If there are misspellings and/or grammar mistakes in your text, you will lose points. 
  We are at the point of becoming professional web designers and nothing makes a web page look more 
  amateur than misspellings and poor grammar!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The  entire site should be in a folder  named <span class="strg">final_project</span> on the ITE server. 
  All image files must be in an <span class="strg">images</span> folder and your css pages
  should be in a <span class="strg">styles</span> folder. </p>
  <p>When you are finished, upload your site to your newly created <span class="strg">final_project</span> 
  folder. Then -- and this part is different from what we have done all semester --  post a message
        on the  <span class="strg">Discussion Board</span>
		(the one  designated for Final Project URLs).  </p>
		<p><span class="strg">Important: Under the URL please list where the following items appear in your site:</span></p>
		
		<ul><li>the 2- or 3- column page</li>
		<li>the image swap, map, or rollover</li>
		<li>the two lists</li>
		<li>the table</li></ul>
 <p><span class="strg">Check </span>to make sure your link works before you post it. Check your site in 
	at least two different browsers. At a minimum, you should make sure that your site looks good in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
      <p>Finally: You must view everyone else's web sites and post a comment about each site on the Discussion Board.
	  Comments should be posted in a separate Discussion Board area.
		The best way to post comments is this: Open a Word or text file and write comments as you go through 
		each site. When you are done viewing all the sites, copy and paste your comments into your Discussion posting.
	  </p>
	  <p><span class ="strg">A note about your comments:</span> Your comments must be thoughtful and polite. &quot;Great
	  work!&quot; is not enough. Mention things you liked about each site but also make good suggestions about
	  things the designer could do to improve.</p>
      <p>The Final Project is due early during the week of Finals.  There will be no extensions! Not for any reason at all.  
	  This is because we must have a few days to allow people to view and comment on all the sites.
	   Check the Calendar for due dates to see when the Project must be posted and when is the 
	   last date to post comments. </p>
