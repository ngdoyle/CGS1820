				<p>Welcome everyone to our new website!  I never thought that when I began this journey, I would end up with my picture on a web page, but here I am!  I hope you look into our methods and our practice with an open mind and a heart for learning.  I promise you, that with hard work and dedication, the results will come.  I know this because I am not just the Founder of Primal Fitness Group, I am a client.</p>
				<p>First, let me begin by saying that I'm not a scientist or a doctor.  Rather I'm an athlete, coach, and student on a lifelong quest for optimal health, happiness, and peak performance. I have an insatiable curiosity about learning what is needed to achieve such goals and a growing mistrust of the answers that have been given to us by the traditional bastions of healthcare wisdom: Big Pharma, Big Agra, the AMA, and the FDA.</p>
				<p>This passion for optimal health and well being has always been a part of me, but it turned into a crusade thirteen years ago when my best friend, my true North, and my wife of 31 years, Karen, was diagnosed with Stage IV malignant metatstatic melanoma. The doctors estimated that she had less than 5 years to live.  They reccommended aggressive chemical and radiation therapies to possibly extend that deadline.  Well, we chose none of those options.  Instead, we turned to our faith, an increase in health education.  I became a certified nutritionists and strength coach, and worked with my wife by taking a PRIMAL, orgranic approach to life that could really make a significant difference without such negative side effects.  I am happy to report that my wife is doing well and continuing her journey by following the principles and protocols that have proven to promote optimal gene expression and health.</p>
				<p>The Primal Fitness Group began as a vision to re-inform us about the fundamentals of health that seem to have been lost or misinterpreted in our modern world.  Our goal for all of our clients is to unlock the wisdom of these behaviors so that we can enjoy optimal health and longevity.  Our goal at the Primal Fitness Group is to change your life and experience the exceptional health that is your right.</p>
				<p>"The Doctor of the future will give no medicine, but instead will interest his patients in the care of human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease."  - Thomas Edison</p>
